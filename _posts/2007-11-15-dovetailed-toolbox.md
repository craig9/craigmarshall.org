{% jpg dovetailed-toolbox %} This is a small toolbox or tool tote made from ash. It has through dovetails on the corners, an inset plywood base, and a shaped handle running from end to end. The handle is attached with through tenons and is double-wedged at each end. I made other boxes similar to this, but using different joinery methods. By making sure the sizes matched, and after adding some small pad feet attached below, they were able to stack quite neatly and not slide around.
