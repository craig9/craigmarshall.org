{% jpg jamies-bookcase %} A built in, painted, MDF constuction. It was quite interesting to learn how to scribe fitted furniture to a wall, and how to fix into the fabric of the house. Here you can see the book case in its unfinshed state. Sadly I wasn't as diligent about taking pictures of finished projects back then. There were built in lights to illuminate the insides too.
