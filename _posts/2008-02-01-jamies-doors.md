{% jpg custom-french-doors %} This is a set of french doors for a custom sized opening. John and I made these from scratch, fitted them and fitted all hardware. I think they're a really nice set of doors.

{% jpg mahogany-doors-01 %} This is a similar project, but raised panel, and internal doors. Made from mahogany (or perhaps Sapele, I think).

{% jpg mahogany-doors-02 %} And the same doors opened. Obviously the handles aren't on in this picture.
