{% jpg alistairs-bookshelf-01 %} John and I were commissioned to build a bookshelf inside the little barn that we converted (along with a bunch of other furniture). I decided it would be nice to be able to show the customer what our designs looked like. So I brushed up on sketchup, and came up with this CAD drawing.

{% jpg alistairs-bookshelf-02 %} Alistair went for the design (after a few minor tweaks), and this is the book shelf in use.
