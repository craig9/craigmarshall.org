{% jpg mahogany-vanity-01 %} At this point, most of my projects involved a CAD sketch - even if it didn't include all details. Any kind of scale drawing is great for picking up things that are slightly "off" regarding proportion and so on.

{% jpg mahogany-vanity-02 %} The wood is all sapele, utile, or other similar mahogany relatives or lookalikes. Most people don't realise that freshly sawn mahogany is anywhere from sandy colour to pale skin tone. It's the stain that makes it looks chestnut brown.

{% jpg mahogany-vanity-04 %} Plywood for use within the panels.

{% jpg mahogany-vanity-05 %} The cabinet ends are frame and panel construction.


{% jpg mahogany-vanity-06 %} The legs have been tapered, and this is a dry fit up for size.

{% jpg mahogany-vanity-07 %} First victims for the stain concoction!

{% jpg mahogany-vanity-08 %} Glue up

{% jpg mahogany-vanity-09 %} Front doors added now
