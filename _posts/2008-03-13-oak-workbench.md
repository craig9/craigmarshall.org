{% jpg oak-workbench-01 %} This is the starting material - after a little processing. It's 75mm thick European oak - some of it worm damaged, but not to any great degree.

{% jpg oak-workbench-02 %} Gluing up the slab in smaller groups makes the job much easier.

{% jpg oak-workbench-03 %} Gluing up the whole slab. Notice the extended Urko brand clamps. These clamps are brilliant.

{% jpg oak-workbench-04 %} Looks good from this angle

{% jpg oak-workbench-05 %} Looks even better from this angle.

{% jpg oak-workbench-06 %} The frame material isn't quite so luxurious - this is some unidentified softwood. First step is to heavily belt sand it in case there are any unnoticed nails. A nail or two will ruin a bandsaw blade (and your day) in no time.

{% jpg oak-workbench-07 %} After ripping on the bandsaw, no nails.

{% jpg oak-workbench-08 %} This is a mix of oak and ash for the other frame members.

{% jpg oak-workbench-09 %} After some more processing

{% jpg oak-workbench-10 %} Here you can see dowel joints for 75mm long beech 10 or 12mm dowels (can't remember exactly)

{% jpg oak-workbench-11 %} The frame going together

{% jpg oak-workbench-12 %} Finally in one piece. It's upside down in this picture so I can make a generous chamfer for each leg.

{% jpg oak-workbench-13 %} Almost done!

{% jpg oak-workbench-14 %} Here's the finished thing with vises mounted and dog holes drilled

{% jpg oak-workbench-15 %} The front vise is a Paramo brand (Record clone) non-quick release vise, with oversize oak jaw. The back half is routed into the bench itself, so the bench becomes the back jaw.

{% jpg oak-workbench-16 %} This is a smaller 7 inch Record brand vise for flat panel clamping. Again oversize jaw - this time to accommodate a removeable bench dog. Great for clamping long panels along with the other dog holes in the bench.
