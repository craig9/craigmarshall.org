{% jpg barn-window-01 %} This was probably the biggest thing John and I had made together. It was approximately 3.6m x 3.6m, mortised and tenoned oak, with protruding Ipe dowelling. We had low-emmissivity double glazing units made, and fitted them from the inside. We moved it in flat pack form, and put it together horizontally, and picked it up with a front end loader and padded lifting slings. Great fun!

{% jpg barn-window-02 %} Same window from a slightly different angle. The two inner upper windows open and so do the two inner lower doors. The other door-and-window like panels are made exactly the same, just not mounted on hinges. This helps to make it look consistent.
