{% jpg domino-jig-1 %} If you don't have the money to splash out on a Domino, then this "Domino jig" might suit you. You need one of the router guide bushing kits to work with this, and ideally an upcut spiral bit of your choice. The perspex or polycarbonate needs to be thicker than your guide bushings. Set the fence square to the slots using a square or a caliper depth probe.
