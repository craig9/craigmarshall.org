{% jpg custom-electric-guitar-1 %} Making an electric guitar had been on my bucket list for a number of years. This one was made from curly sycamore and mahogany. The mahogany was salvaged from some window frames that John and I removed from a house (to replace). I just couldn't let the wood go to waste.
