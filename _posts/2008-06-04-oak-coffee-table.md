{% jpg oak-coffee-table-1 %} This project solved two problems. First, we had a need for a nice coffee table. Second, I accidentally cut a piece of wood (that I shouldn't hve) to the length of this table. Rather than worry about that, I paid for the wood, and made it into this table. This image shows the two halves of the top being edge-joined.

{% jpg oak-coffee-table-2 %} This image shows two thicknesses of wood being face-joined, and they will later be ripped along the length, to produce two square section pieces, which will become legs.
