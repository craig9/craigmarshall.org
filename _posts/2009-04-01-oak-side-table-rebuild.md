{% jpg oak-side-table-1 %} I noticed that mum had acquired an old ruined oak side table, with gate legs and drop leaves. It was split, warped, had holes in it, and the joinery was seriously coming undone. I offered to re-imagine it as something more usable that could actually be used as furniture.

{% jpg oak-side-table-2 %} After cutting apart the good bits, and a lot of head scratching, I came up with this. Totally different from the original, but this is making the best of the available material. There was a single hole left in the top, which was pretty much unavoidable. Maybe it can serve as a reminder of where the table came from.
