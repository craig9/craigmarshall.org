{% jpg pappinisseri-timti-knife-1 %} My grandad was given this knife, who gave it to my dad, who gave it to me. Somewhere along the line it got badly damaged by someone that is a bit hamfisted with the bench grinder.

{% jpg pappinisseri-timti-knife-2 %} After a bit of time lapping the blade flat, I managed to get this nice finish on it.
