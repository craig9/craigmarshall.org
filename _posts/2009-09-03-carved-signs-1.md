During 2009 and 2010 I started and ran a business selling hand carved signs through a website that I developed and promoted. I made a full time wage with the sign carving business, but it was too physically taxing (on my neck and shoulders) to keep it going. Still - I made a lot of signs, mostly for UK customers, but the odd one went to the states and one set of signs even went to to Ibiza.
