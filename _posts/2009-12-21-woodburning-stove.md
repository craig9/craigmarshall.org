{% jpg woodburning-stove-1 %} This is a woodburning stove I designed and built from scratch. It's extremely heavy, being made from 8 and 10mm steel plate.

{% jpg woodburning-stove-2 %} It worked really well - my parents adopted it when I didn't need it any more, and they added a glass window to the door. A good upgrade.
