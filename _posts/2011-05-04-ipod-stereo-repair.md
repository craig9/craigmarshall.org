{% jpg ipod-stereo-repair-1 %} I neglected to take a before pic, but a job came in where I had to diagnose and correct a problem with an iPod compatible stereo system. I found that the thermal fuse buried in the transformer had blown. Hoping that the rest of the circuit was fine, and replacing the transformer with a larger (higher power rating) equivalent, with the same voltage rating, cured the problem.

{% jpg ipod-stereo-repair-3 %} New transformer installed. The new one has a centre-tap, but I cut that short and treated it as a standard 9v transformer.
