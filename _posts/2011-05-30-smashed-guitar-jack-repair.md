{% jpg smashed-jack-repair-1 %} This guitar was accidentally kicked over on-stage, smashing the wood around the audio jack.

{% jpg smashed-jack-repair-2 %} After removing all loose chips from around the hole, and checking the jack's thickness capacity, I made a curved steel plate with an opening that the jack itself could fit through. The steel plate is to sit on the inside of the guitar, strengthening the weak area.

{% jpg smashed-jack-repair-3 %} The low area was built up to the correct shape using a combination of adding epoxy resin, scraping and fine sanding with wet and dry paper.

{% jpg smashed-jack-repair-4 %} The final picture is actually missing, the surface was buffed to a high sheen, and doesn't look very noticable at all, considering the amount of damage done.
