{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-1 %} I bought a nice Stanley No. 4 plane, but the body was fairly rusted, the blade back wasn't flat, and the handles wouldn't tighten up very well. I thought it could do with a bit of a clean up.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-2 %} Electrolysis is my favourite method of rust removal, but I occasionally have to use acid, or wire brushes, or various methods. The paint is an epoxy enamel and it's just going on.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-3 %} Painting done.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-4 %} When I started flattening the back of the blade, it was very unflat.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-5 %} Slow progress.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-6 %} Getting there.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-7 %} And the brass pieces have been cleaned up and buffed. All done.

{% jpg stanley-4-cleanup-8 %} After a test, it appears to work well.
