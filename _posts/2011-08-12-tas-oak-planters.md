{% jpg tas-oak-planters-1 %} After building the greenhouse (with Jason), the owner needed some planters to put inside.

{% jpg tas-oak-planters-2 %} Close up (not the finest work I've done!)

{% jpg tas-oak-planters-3 %} Lots of timber. Simple work, but tiring.

{% jpg tas-oak-planters-4 %} All done! There are no bases in these planters, they drain direct to the concrete.
