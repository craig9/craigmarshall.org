{% jpg 12m-steel-greenhouse-1 %} In the summer of 2011, I fabricated a 12M long steel greenhouse (with a friend Jason). The job was started by another company, but the quality wasn't really good enough, and that makes the job harder than just starting from scratch. This and the next few photos show the problems. Holes in welds, flux not removed, and all those problems were painted over. This creates a lot of grinding work to redo the job properly.
