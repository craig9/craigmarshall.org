{% jpg porch-frame-1 %} I fabricated this replacement frame for a porch which was previously using a timber frame. The timber frame was thoroughly rotten. Step one is to prop up the rotten frame and measure how big the frame needs to be, when the sagging rotten timber is hel properly.

{% jpg porch-frame-2 %} The finished item.

{% jpg porch-frame-3 %} Bolted into the concrete.

{% jpg porch-frame-4 %} Capped ends, and steps for the fascia to sit on. Also bolted through the fascia.

{% jpg porch-frame-5 %} The other end is pretty much the same. Should last a very long time.
