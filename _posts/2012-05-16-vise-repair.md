{% jpg vise-repair-1 %} This no-name vise spindle broke off when tightening the vise one day. No excessive force was used, no "cheater bar" or anything, just a defect in the steel used, I think. I did not have access to a lathe when I made this repair, so I tapered one part using the bench grinder, in order to get full weld penetration, and I flattened the other part on the bench grinder, because there wasn't enough material to taper it. I used a v-block made from aluminium angle, with a square end, to align the shoulder of the spindle end.

{% jpg vise-repair-3 %} After the boot-shine method sanding with strips of coarse sandpaper. The repair worked great, and I couldn't break the handle again with my bodyweight, so I think it's stronger than before. The head didn't get welded on with 100% perfect alignment, but it works fine. If I were to do the repair again today, I use the lathe to reface the rear of that register area.
