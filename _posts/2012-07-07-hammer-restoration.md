{% jpg hammer-restoration-1 %} I quite enjoy bring old tools back to life, so when I see something simple like this rusted hammer head with a dinged up face and a broken off handle, I see it as a challenge.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-3 %} A bit of wire brushing gets the loose stuff off. Electrolysis takes the rest off.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-4 %} A bit of filing, sanding and buffing gets the face nice and smooth.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-5 %} I won't make every surface look like new, a few battle scars on non-functional faces is no problem.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-6 %} I selected a piece of Tas Oak for the handle. Hickory is best. Ash would be pretty good. Tas Oak is not a great choice really.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-7 %} A mortise is cut that fits the narrow end of the hammer head socket. Claw hammer sockets flare in two directions, so you have to put a wooden wedge in one way and then spread it the other way too with wooden or metal wedges.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-8 %} A bit of rough shaping with a rasp.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-9 %} A bit more shaping.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-10 %} Chamfer the sides off to meet the head nicely.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-11 %} First wedge is wooden and goes in front-to-back.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-12 %} Tenon is trimmed, and next wedge is metal and goes left-to-right.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-13 %} Shaping and wedging complete.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-14 %} First coat or two of oil.

{% jpg hammer-restoration-15 %} After several coats the hammer picks up a lovely sheen. Sadly the handle broke on pretty much first use. Using Tas Oak was a bit of a gamble, use hickory if you can! 

{% jpg hammer-restoration-16 %} The head is still in great condition, but I've put the handle down as a learning experience.
