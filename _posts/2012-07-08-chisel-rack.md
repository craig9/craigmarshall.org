{% jpg chisel-rack-1 %} It had got to the point where I had two chisels or gouges in every pocket on my chisel roll. Not great for the chisel edges.

{% jpg chisel-rack-2 %} I experimented with making a makeshift large (35mm+) "countersink" bit to see which hole shapes would work for all chisels and gouges. I settled on a countersunk keyhole shape where the slot would allow the neck of the chisel to pass freely, but the countersink would support the lower end of the handle.

{% jpg chisel-rack-3 %} I drilled a bunch of 16mm holes

{% jpg chisel-rack-4 %} And then cut a bunch of 13mm slots to make them into keyholes

{% jpg chisel-rack-5 %} And softened and countersunk all the edges

{% jpg chisel-rack-6 %} Gluing onto a vertical riser to give the chisels something to rest on, and some way of attaching it to the wall.

{% jpg chisel-rack-7 %} I much prefer a cabinet scraper to sandpaper when I can get away with it. The shavings are much easier to deal with than the dust from sanding. 

{% jpg chisel-rack-8 %} A quick double curve made up in Inkscape. I could have freehanded this, but I decided I wanted it to be symmetrical, so I had to make a template of some kind.

{% jpg chisel-rack-9 %} Two bandsaw cuts later, and some block planing to produce a chamfer, and I have a decorative edge.

{% jpg chisel-rack-10 %} The chisels fit the space well.
