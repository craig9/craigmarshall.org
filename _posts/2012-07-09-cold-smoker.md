{% jpg cold-smoker-1 %} This is the finished smoker - sadly I didn't take any pictures during the making of. I had to learn about bend allowances, and how to use a shear, nibbler, finger brake and other sheetmetalwork tools, and it was great fun. The smoker is made from galvanised steel sheet, about 0.9mm thick if my memory is correct. That doesn't sound thick, but when you include some bends and seams, it becomes very stiff and strong.

{% jpg cold-smoker-3 %} This is the first couple of courses of bricks for the smoke source - which was an old cast iron cooker which itself needed restoration. Lots of preheating and nickel rods were used to fix cracked castings, and it turned out to be a big project.

{% jpg cold-smoker-4 %} Here is an almost finished picture. Sadly I didn't get a picture of the long smoke ducting tube! It had a vertical section, used for lighting the fire, and also a long section travelling off to the right over a several meter run, with a slight rise. The idea of this is to cool the smoke down so the food only gets cold smoke around 20 degrees C getting to it. There was a butterfly valve in each smoke path, so the volume of smoke taking each path could be finely controlled. Cold smoking takes a long time, overnight for example, so the fire has to be able to burn for a long time without attention.
