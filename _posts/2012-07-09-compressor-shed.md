{% jpg compressor-shed %} The requirement for this job was to make a stiff and stable enclosure, with rain resistance, and breathability (the compressor has to breathe, and stay cool). It didn't need to be terribly heavy, being floor-less and wall-less on one side, so the decision was made to leave a doorway out of the equation and make an enclosure that could be slid away from the compressor for easy maintenance.
