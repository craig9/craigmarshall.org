{% jpg welding-cart-1 %} As with most things I build, I'm using recycled materials. This stuff is powdercoated, and needed to be stripped with flap disks, and 3m stripping disks. It was also fairly full of holes, so those needed plug welding.

{% jpg welding-cart-2 %} To make it as strong as possible, I did lap joints on the corners, there is more joint length than with a 45 degree mitre, and less chance of the frame being pulled out of square. There is more work involved in this method though.

{% jpg welding-cart-3 %} Lap joint tacked up

{% jpg welding-cart-4 %} Almost complete

{% jpg welding-cart-5 %} One full joint complete

{% jpg welding-cart-6 %} After a whole bunch more of that kind of thing, I have the basic structure together.

{% jpg welding-cart-7 %} I don't like the idea of welding casters to the frame, I like to make pads for them, so they can be replaced easily in future.

{% jpg welding-cart-8 %} Easier to tap the mounting holes for the casters before the pads get welded to the frame.

{% jpg welding-cart-9 %} Setting up to figure out the height needed for the rear fixed axle.

{% jpg welding-cart-10 %} And now everything's in one piece, 

{% jpg welding-cart-11 %} After adding some tabs for the plywood to sit on (a temporary measure), I can put the welder on it.

I have some more modifications planned for the cart (better storage for TIG welding rods, a small drawer for ceramic cups, electrodes and so on, and checkerplate for the flat panels). Also it needs to be painted, even though this is five years later... Stay tuned for updates.
