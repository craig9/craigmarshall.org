I have a thing about Dawn vises! They remind me of the Record vise my dad used to use. They seem well made and strong, and fairly common place in Australia. I haven't ever broken one, but I see plenty of well used ones for sale. As of when this article was written (2018), I've owned three of them. The first was a 3" (75mm) model, which Rick gave to me. That was cleaned up and passed on to a good friend (Geoff), who is still using it. Then I bought this one, a 4 1/2" SP model (115mm jaws). The SP stands for Standard Pattern. They also made a Light Pattern, which has larger jaw capacity, but the body size and weight of the next vise size down. Then I bought a 5" LP (127mm jaws), that one was cleaned up and sold on to a new owner.

{% jpg dawn-vise-refurb-2 %} It's actually in great condition, no cracks, plenty of jaw grip left, and no slop in the slides or threads.

{% jpg dawn-vise-refurb-3 %} The nut inside lifts out, which makes it much easier to clean.

{% jpg dawn-vise-refurb-4 %} I had to deburr the top flat surface a little, but not much. These tend to get abused, and used as an anvil.

{% jpg dawn-vise-refurb-7 %} After paint stripping, and a light touch with a flap disk to some of the casting seams.

{% jpg dawn-vise-refurb-8 %} And I'm spraying it CIG blue, to go with my CIG welder (same as Miller welder blue).

{% jpg dawn-vise-refurb-10 %} This is the same vise 5 years later. I wouldn't use that spray on paint again, and next time I'd use primer, even though the can says you don't need to. I think the next colour will not be shocking blue, too. Machinery gray epoxy enamel over a proper primer layer, brushed on. Look out for a future re-refurb article.
