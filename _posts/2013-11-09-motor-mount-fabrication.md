{% jpg motor-mount-1 %} While dismantling an old broken treadmill that I picked up for free, I came across this 3/4hp induction motor.

{% jpg motor-mount-2 %} I decided to try using it as the motor for my new table saw. That saw should have a 2hp+ motor on it, but I decided I'd try it anyway. The downside was the motor was not a foot mount motor. The green platform you see is part of my table saw, and as you can see there's no way to fix the motor to it.

{% jpg motor-mount-3 %} I decided to fabricate a steel collar and foot mount for it. This would involve finding some kind of form, for bending the steel collar, since I didn't have any proper bending or rolling tools.

{% jpg motor-mount-4 %} The flat bar I'm going to shape.

{% jpg motor-mount-5 %} It was a lot of work..

{% jpg motor-mount-6 %} .. but I got the shape into the flat bar.

{% jpg motor-mount-7 %} Now the collar is formed, it's time to take off the pivots and things from the motor casing.

{% jpg motor-mount-8 %} The two ears here were used for tensioning the motor. They had to go.

{% jpg motor-mount-9 %} After cutting off anything "extraneous", I gave the bare steel parts a squirt of black paint to protect the steel.

{% jpg motor-mount-10 %} The collar needed some ears welding onto it, so I got the TIG machine out and practised my welding.

{% jpg motor-mount-11 %} The bolts are for clamping the collar closed on the motor body.

{% jpg motor-mount-12 %} I was careful to make sure the motor spacing was the same as the old (3ph) motor I was replacing.

{% jpg motor-mount-13 %} I tacked everything in place.

{% jpg motor-mount-14 %} And after finishing the welding, and painting it a similar green colour to the saw, it was done. And it worked well - but not really powerful enough for the table saw! Today (2018) it's the temporary motor for my 20" bandsaw build. I'll see if it's powerful enough for that, otherwise, I'll look for something bigger. 1.5hp or 2hp.
