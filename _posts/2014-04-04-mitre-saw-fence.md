{% jpg mitre-saw-fence %} When I upgraded to a larger table saw, I traded my small table saw for a Makita Mitre Saw. When I got it the fence was broken. I decided to use Inkscape to produce some templates to make a new fence. The stepped area behind the blade emulates the beveled area on the original, and this gives clearance for the spinning blade. It worked brilliantly and was still on the saw, and still perfectly accurate years later when I sold the saw. (After using a crosscut sled on the table saw for a while, I had no need for a mitre saw as well).
