{% jpg table-saw-accessories %} A woodworking machine is only slightly useful until you kit it out with various workholding jigs, fixtures and accessories. A basic start for a table saw will include a cross cut sled and some push sticks (painted so they don't get mistaken for scrap wood). The flat paddles are made of ply, and shaped handles, and have rubber drawer liner glued to the bottom surface, they're actually for use with the jointer, but they snuck into this photo.
