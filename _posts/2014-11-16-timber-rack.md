{% jpg timber-rack-1 %} I was in need of a timber rack and I spotted a double bed being discarded, it was made of fairly clean pine boards. Those boards were very chunky, and made an ideal start for a timber rack. To put my money where my mouth is regarding the strength of ordinary wood glue vs timber, I thought half-lap joints with no other mechanical fixings would be a good joint to use.

{% jpg timber-rack-2 %} The middle shelves aren't quite as deep, and of course the bottom joint sees all the load, so it's using the widest board.

{% jpg timber-rack-4 %} The two halves are joined together with braces that are just screwed in place. This allows it to be collapsed if necessary for moving.

{% jpg timber-rack-5 %} Well - it holds hundreds of kg of wood, and has never moved or broken. I used it for about 4 years until I started storing more metal than wood, and decided that storing the items upright was just as efficient.
