{% jpg woodgears-shelf %} I made my first [woodgears inspired shelving](https://woodgears.ca/storage/shelving.html) in 2014. [woodgears.ca](woodgears.ca), and the associated YouTube videos are a fantastic resource. I have now built the sawhorses Matthias has designed, three small sets of the shelves, and I'm currently (it's late 2018) mid-way through the build of a 20" bandsaw. I can't recommend any of these designs highly enough.
