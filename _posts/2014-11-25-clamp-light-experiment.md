{% jpg clamp-light-1 %} When I got home with all this, I wondered if I'd miscalculated the cost of building lamps vs. buying. I decided to carry on anyway, just for fun. There is a practical side to this too. I needed lamps that clamp on because I don't want to make permanent wiring changes to the rented place I'm in, and I needed them to not only be low profile, but negative profile, i.e. tuck up into the space between the floor joists. I don't really know if those are available to buy.

{% jpg clamp-light-2 %} First step is to measure the stainless mixing bowls I picked up for around $1 Australian per piece.

{% jpg clamp-light-3 %} Drilling with a holesaw was difficult. Use the lowest RPM, and press hard, and use coolant.

{% jpg clamp-light-4 %} I had to file the opening too, to get the bayonet fitting through the bowl.

{% jpg clamp-light-6 %} Using the home made angle gauge to determine the angle.

{% jpg clamp-light-7 %} Cutting a piece to the right angle.

{% jpg clamp-light-8 %} Cutting some plywood as the outer layers of the sandwich

{% jpg clamp-light-9 %} And pine as the inner layers.

{% jpg clamp-light-10 %} Tapping the pine directly for an M8 or M10 thread (I forget)

{% jpg clamp-light-11 %}

{% jpg clamp-light-12 %} Gluing the assembly together.

{% jpg clamp-light-13 %} And in place. It works really well. You could make these quite efficiently if you had to make a bunch of them. Firstly the whole arm could be made of one double layer of ply (not sure why I didn't do that), and they could be nested together on the plywood sheet to minimise waste.

{% jpg clamp-light-14 %} The reflector works perfectly, and because it's deeper than the bulb and because the reflector and bulb are nestled between those floor joists, the whole thing is pretty bump resistant.
