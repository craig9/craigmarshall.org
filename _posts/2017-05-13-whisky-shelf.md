{% jpg whisky-shelf-1 %} Alvin (my father in law) has an extensive collection of whisky, and he was in need of some "stadium seating" for the top of a particular cabinet so that the labels of the bottles at the rear were visible. I took the available vertical space, and divided it up, and came up with this design. The joinery is glue and screws. Once the glue has gone off, the screws are removed, and drilled oversize for dowels, which makes for a very neat and strong joint.
