{% jpg bandsaw-build-1 %} The bandsaw I'm replacing. An old, low-power and low-rigidity 3-wheeler. Not ideal, but better than nothing!

{% jpg bandsaw-build-1b %} This is the end goal, a 20"/500mm width capacity bandsaw with a 15"/375mm resawing capability. For the plans, please head to (http://woodgears.ca)[http://woodgears.ca], which is where I purchased mine from. Matthias is an awesome guy. He's very knowledgeable about bandsaws, and has built several so far.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-2 %} The hardware I am starting with. A 3/4 horsepower induction motor from a treadmill, with a home fabricated steel foot-mount, some pulleys, some 30mm shafting and bearings I bought for this project several years ago, and various pulleys, belts and knobs.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-3 %} Sheets of 18mm and 6mm hardwood ply, and some softwood.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-4 %} A temporary trammel (like a big compass)

{% jpg bandsaw-build-5 %} Rough cutting the 20"/50cm disks of hardwood ply. Each wheel is made up of 2 layers of 18mm, for a thickness of 36mm per wheel.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-6 %} These squares with radiused corners will become the bearing hubs.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-7 %} Gluing the wheels together in pairs. Not enough clamps!

{% jpg bandsaw-build-8 %} Boring the bearing mounts for a 0.5mm interference fit on my small milling machine. I'm using 6206 bearings. 30mm ID, 62mm OD, and 16mm thickness.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-9 %} After press fitting the bearings. These are Japanese Nachi brand bearings.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-10 %} I needed to make a temporary pulley, using questionable methods on the table saw.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-11 %} Temporary pulley done.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-12 %} Here are the parts I've made so far.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-13 %} Added some small holes, and some small clamps help clamp the first bearing sides on. End of day one (Monday).

{% jpg bandsaw-build-14 %} This spacer holds the drive pulley out from the rear side of the lower wheel.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-15 %} When you don't have a woodworking lathe that can spin something 500mm in diameter, you improvise! The motor is sat on a spacer on a stool, the wheel is spinning on its bearings on the 30mm shaft, which is held in soft jaws in the bench vise, and I have stacked up my saw horses with some spacers on top as a tool post. The toolpost wasn't rigid enough (and didn't have enough mass) to dampen vibrations induced through turning an irregular shape. Especially in hardwood plywood. I tried adding lead blocks to the chisel which really helped.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-16 %} The wheels are complete, including the final drive pulley, made up of two layers of 12mm ply. This was the stage I have been the most concerned about, so I'm glad it's over. The wheels now have a coat of varnish, but I don't have pics of that yet. The turning of the wheel rims and the final drive pulley took a whole day. This marks the end of day two.
