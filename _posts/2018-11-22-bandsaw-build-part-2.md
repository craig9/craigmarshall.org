{% jpg bandsaw-build-17 %} I only had half a day available today, due to it being shopping day. Anyway - I got all 77 pieces of pine and tas oak that will make up the laminated frame rough cut and ready to size to final dimension. Right now it's just a big pile of timber, but over the next couple of days, it will become a bandsaw frame. End of day three (Wednesday). Stay tuned for more, I expect this will take me weeks, but I'll keep posting pictures if anyone is interested.


{% jpg bandsaw-build-18 %} All frame parts are now precisely cut and notched and angled etc. This is the first stack

{% jpg bandsaw-build-19 %} And this is the second stack.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-20 %} The first few pieces being laminated together. Now I have about a day of gluing and clamping to get this big C frame together.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-21 %} Laminating the bandsaw frame is a significant job. Here we are with 37 of the 77 total bandsaw frame pieces joined together. Nearly at the halfway mark. Only 40 to go. I hope to get most of the remainder done today, with any luck.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-22 %} This kind of laminated construction is fairly "messy" compared to normal joinery, and needed a bit of a tune up with a Stanley No. 6 fore plane.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-25 %} I'm on the home stretch now. It's going to be pretty massive. Last few pieces to add to the back and some more flattening and cleanup. and then onto the wheelmounts.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-26 %} It's taken a few days, but the frame is complete.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-28 %} View from the right (that face you can see is made up of 19 separate pieces of wood). Careful planing needed to get everything flat and perpendicular.
