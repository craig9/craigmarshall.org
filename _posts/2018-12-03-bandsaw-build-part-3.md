{% jpg bandsaw-build-30 %} Next up is the wheel mounts which involves gathering the hardware needed...

{% jpg bandsaw-build-31 %} ... and gluing up some blanks to be shaped into the mounts.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-32 %} The upper wheel mount frame

{% jpg bandsaw-build-33 %} And the tilting piece that goes in that frame

{% jpg bandsaw-build-34 %} The other side of that tilting piece

{% jpg bandsaw-build-35 %} And the rear and front portions of the lower wheelmount.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-36 %} That upper frame is now glued, but it's time to reinforce the corners with spline joints.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-37 %} It looks a mess right now, but with splines, it's super strong.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-38 %} Turning up some custom aluminium washers to stop the wheels coming off the end of the shafts.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-39 %} They look like this when finished.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-40 %} The shafts are then cut to length (roughly, will cut them shorter later when I've worked out how long they need to be exactly). The end caps fit well.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-41 %} And I milled up a small stainless rub plate for the point where the tilt knob will contact the upper wheelmount.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-42 %} The wheels are mounted

{% jpg bandsaw-build-43 %} A view of the rear - you can see the upper tilting mechanism.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-44 %} The new saw next to the old one. Quite a bit bigger.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-45 %} Using the metal lathe to cut wood :-)

{% jpg bandsaw-build-46 %} The spacers, leaf springs and tensioner crank.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-47 %} First test cut!

{% jpg bandsaw-build-48 %} I clamped a 3/4hp motor temporarily to run the saw.
