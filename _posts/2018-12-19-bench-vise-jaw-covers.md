{% jpg bench-vise-jaw-covers %} I had a great deal of trouble recently removing the jaws from my vise, in the end I managed to do it, but I had to destroy the screws (which were rusted in there), to get the jaws off. I was left with 2 of 4 good screws. The idea behind taking them off was to make some solid aluminium jaws, which is still on the todo list. This is an interim solution, made from 25x25x3mm aluminium angle. I simply cut the angle to length on the bandsaw, cut an end-flap to better hold it on, and hammered those around the ends of the jaws. Works great!
