{% jpg mill-vise-stop-1 %} While I was working on the blade guide mounts for the bandsaw, I remember that I badly need some kind of stop for the vise, so I can put work in the vise repeatably, without changing my setup.

{% jpg mill-vise-stop-2 %} The sides of the vise are already drilled and tapped M10, so all I needed was a block with a 10mm clearance hole, and a threaded portion so I can adjust the left-right position of the end of a screw.

I ground and polished the end of the cap screw, so it resembles a ball bearing, this prevents damaging the workpiece, but also minimises the contact area, so stuff can't get caught between the screw and the workpiece.
