{% jpg bandsaw-build-49 %} Cutting a large block of aluminium to turn into the blade guide mounts. On the original plans this is hardwood, but I like the idea of upgrading some of the more important parts to metal.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-50 %} Blade guide mounts to final size, just need to drill and tap some holes.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-51 %} Machining a piece of brass hex bar into flat bar. I don't have any better shaped material, but it's not too hard to mill it to what I need.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-52 %} Brass milled. This will become the blade guides, which stop the blade from twisting in a cut.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-53 %} Two of the four blade guides need to be 28 degrees off square. The red box is my digital angle gauge - a very handy tool. I can zero it on the table or the top of the vise, and then hold it against a workpiece to get any angle I want.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-54 %} Milling the edge of a piece of salvaged stainless steel. This will be cut up into the blade guide retainers.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-55 %} A stack of metal parts! Still a couple more metal parts to make, and some holes to drill and tap in these parts. Then a stack of wooden parts, and the blade guides will be done.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-56 %} A mystery-grade aluminium scrap that will become the bearing retainers

{% jpg bandsaw-build-57 %} Here they are finished.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-58 %} And here they are assembled, as they will be on the finished machine.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-59 %} Holes drilled and tapped in the blade guide retainers

{% jpg bandsaw-build-60 %} Blade guides assembled. Now onto the blade guide post and other wooden parts that hold these to the bandsaw, and allow for adjustment.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-61 %} Gluing up some blanks of hardwood plywood, and hardwood

{% jpg bandsaw-build-62 %} The finished guide blocks, upper blade guide post, lower blade guide slides

{% jpg bandsaw-build-63 %} This bit is a bit nerve-wracking - cutting into the main frame of the saw. 

{% jpg bandsaw-build-64 %} Using Matthias' method of making many saw cuts, then hammering out the waste, then cleaning up with a chisel.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-65 %} The guide post and the rebate.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-66 %} After this pic was taken, I stood the saw back up, re-attached the top wheel, and spent a good long while making sure the guide post moved co-axially with the blade. Using the blade guides to set up a known amount of left-right clearance, I was able to plane and tune the rebate surfaces so that the guide bar was held square, and parallel. And the clearance was set to be equal wherever the guide bar was in relation to the upper wheel. It was also set fore-aft in the same way.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-67 %} After some careful measuring and testing, setting the rebate in place on the guide post clamping plate

{% jpg bandsaw-build-68 %} A nice 2mm thick piece of powerdcoated steel will become the blade guard. Just need to cut the piece down to size.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-69 %} Bandsaw makes short work of cutting to length

{% jpg bandsaw-build-70 %} Some hand work with the file to deburr the edges

{% jpg bandsaw-build-71 %} I rough cut the long edges with the bandsaw, and then milled the edges to final size.

Still to come: A picture of the blade guide post clamped to the frame. I should have used epoxy to glue the threaded rod into the frame, it's still curing 24h later...
