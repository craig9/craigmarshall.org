{% jpg bandsaw-build-72 %} First step was to print out the 1:1 scale templates, then cut out some suitable oversize blanks, and then glue the innards in place, aligning with the openings/mortises in the drawing.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-73 %} Some of the simpler steps of this stage. Making up some dowel for the trunnion cradle to trunnion beam joints. These are 12.5mm x 120mm long. Made the two trunning lock knobs, too. Off-camera, I sized up the glued up trunnion beam and cut a blade relief in one side. The wheel relief in the other side could pose a problem, it's not going to be a safe cut on my one-sided table saw sled. I might have to whip up a quick small table saw sled. The other option is to use hand tools to make the cut.
