{% jpg bandsaw-build-72 %} First step was to print out the 1:1 scale templates, then cut out some suitable oversize blanks, and then glue the innards in place, aligning with the openings/mortises in the drawing.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-73 %} Some of the simpler steps of this stage. Making up some dowel for the trunnion cradle to trunnion beam joints. These are 12.5mm x 120mm long. Made the two trunning lock knobs, too. Off-camera, I sized up the glued up trunnion beam and cut a blade relief in one side. The wheel relief in the other side could pose a problem, it's not going to be a safe cut on my one-sided table saw sled. I might have to whip up a quick small table saw sled. The other option is to use hand tools to make the cut.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-74 %} Here are the trunnions and trunnion cradles fresh from the old bandsaw. Using some vaguely similar techniques that I've read about scraping in cast iron machinery parts, I'm spot working the bearing surfaces so that the alignment is good, and the percentage of surface bearing is good. I'm not using any blue compound for marking, I'm using high pressure and friction between the parts to produce shiny areas, and checking with a square and a straight edge, for alignment, I'm getting the curved surfaces perpendicular to the part faces, and I'm improving the contact area between the parts by selectively removing high points.
