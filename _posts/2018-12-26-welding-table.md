{% jpg welding-table-1 %} This is what the welding table will be built around - a piece of 6mm thick mild steel, bought from a local engineering/fabrication company. It's 1200mm x 600mm.

{% jpg welding-table-2 %} And this nurse/doctor bed type thing will be the donor for the steel frame. It needs pretty heavy modification though. First is to remove the pad that the patient lies on.

{% jpg welding-table-3 %} Then cut it to length to make it suit the steel top I have. The water coming out of the frame was a surprise, it was stored outside at the tipshop, but I didn't expect it to be waterlogged..

{% jpg welding-table-4 %} Section cut out, and I'll reuse the end frame.

{% jpg welding-table-5 %} Cleaning up the weld areas so I get a decent weld.

{% jpg welding-table-6 %} Tacked ..

{% jpg welding-table-7 %} .. and welded.

{% jpg welding-table-8 %} Using the piece I cut out, I decided I could probably reinforce the new smaller frame. So I selected the straight pieces, and had a think about how I could improve things.

{% jpg welding-table-9 %} First decision was to weld some upper members in, that run front to back, at each end.

{% jpg welding-table-10 %} Before I forget, I add some caster plates to the bottom of the feet, so the casters are removeable and replaceable.

{% jpg welding-table-11 %} Some more of that spare frame material becomes some bracing for the rear of the frame. Short so as not to intrude on leg space under the table.

{% jpg welding-table-12 %} Clamped in place.

{% jpg welding-table-13 %} The right hand brace was tig-welded right handed.

{% jpg welding-table-14 %} And the left hand brace was tig-welded left handed, just for practise.

{% jpg welding-table-15 %} The frame so far.

{% jpg welding-table-16 %} After drilling and tapping those caster pads (only in two corners for now), I could add the casters and see how it worked.

{% jpg welding-table-17 %} Looking good.

{% jpg welding-table-18 %} For a good paint job, you need to take off all the old paint, so the flap disk and angle grinder got a good workout.

{% jpg welding-table-19 %} After painting with more of that CIG blue colour.
