{% jpg bandsaw-build-72 %} First step was to print out the 1:1 scale templates, then cut out some suitable oversize blanks, and then glue the innards in place, aligning with the openings/mortises in the drawing.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-73 %} Some of the simpler steps of this stage. Making up some dowel for the trunnion cradle to trunnion beam joints. These are 12.5mm x 120mm long. Made the two trunning lock knobs, too. Off-camera, I sized up the glued up trunnion beam and cut a blade relief in one side. The wheel relief in the other side could pose a problem, it's not going to be a safe cut on my one-sided table saw sled. I might have to whip up a quick small table saw sled. The other option is to use hand tools to make the cut.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-74 %} Here are the trunnions and trunnion cradles fresh from the old bandsaw. Using some vaguely similar techniques that I've read about scraping in cast iron machinery parts, I'm spot working the bearing surfaces so that the alignment is good, and the percentage of surface bearing is good. I'm not using any blue compound for marking, I'm using high pressure and friction between the parts to produce shiny areas, and checking with a square and a straight edge, for alignment, I'm getting the curved surfaces perpendicular to the part faces, and I'm improving the contact area between the parts by selectively removing high points.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-75 %} I didn't fancy the cross-cut sled method of removing this waste material. My sled isn't double-sided, so there was very little support for the workpiece. Instead I decided to use a saw and chisel.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-76 %} Five minutes later and I've removed the bulk of the material. Still a little clean up to go, to take the opening neatly to the line.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-77 %} With the trunnion beam, trunnion cradles and the trunnions themselves, the setup will look like this.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-78 %} A quick side-project is to make this 1/2" (12.7mm) standard jobber drill bit into a brad point bit. I've not seen anyone else do this, but I've done it before as you see on the left, that's my previous attempt at making an 8mm one.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-79 %} Ten minutes later and I have a 1/2" brad point bit, ready for use with the 1/2" dowelling I have in stock.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-80 %} The bit cuts like butter through this hardwood ply, and it leaves a clean exit hole. Good drill bits are a joy to use.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-81 %} Gluing the crades to the beam without dowels at this stage. Once the glue has dried, I'll drill through the cradle holes made earlier, and into the beam itself. The dowels are prepped already, so it's just a case of waiting for the first lot of glue to dry.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-82 %} Now the 10 dowels are in (Home made brad point bit to the rescue again)

{% jpg bandsaw-build-83 %} This is a mock up of where I hope to get to by the end of the day. I have replaced the glue holding the guide post threaded rod in place. The polyurethane adhesive still wasn't dry after 3 days, so I drilled it out, used mineral spirits to clean the drill bit, and then epoxied a new piece of threaded rod in place. It was cured in 30 minutes. The trunnion beam is just sat in place for now, the lower guides are also just sat in place.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-84 %} Here the trunnion beam is fixed to the frame, and the lower guides are fixed to the trunnion beam. The trunnions themselves are just sat there for now, to show where they will go.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-86 %} Lower layer of the table just sat in place to show scale. I've increased the design 100mm on the left, 30mm on the right and 15mm front and back.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-89 %} Gluing the lower table layer.

{% jpg bandsaw-build-90 %} Just waiting for glue now.

Coming next: Got to fit the trunninons to the table, rout an insert plate slot, make the carriage bolt bushings for the trunnions, and add the frame reinforcement piece underneath the trunnion beam.
