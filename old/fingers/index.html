		<h1>My 2009 Finger Injury</h1>

		<p style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Don't put your fingers near or into running machines</p>

		<p>This is the type of machine I was using, a Felder AD 741 planer thicknesser. A piece of wood was picked up by the moving blades, and I reflexively put my hand down to stop the wood moving away. The wood had already gone and my fingers went into the large cutter block, driven by a multi-horsepower motor. I am lucky to have not lost entire fingers or a hand.</p> 

		<p>This incident happened after 2 or so years of using the machine, on a daily basis, in a relatively safe way. I had no previous mistakes or near misses at all.</p>

		<p>The first three pictures were taken after 9 days. The yellow staining is from the regular application of iodine.</p>

		<p>After 33 days</p>

		<p>And finally after 120 days. At this stage it was still painful to drum my fingers on the table. I guess this cured my impatient streak. Nowadays (2014), I can drum my fingers again pain-free, but my fingertips are an odd shape, and the fingerprints are screwed up.</p>
